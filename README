Welcome to our 15424 Project!

Before running any of our code, please install pytorch:
python3 -m pip install torch==1.7.1+cpu torchvision==0.8.2+cpu torchaudio==0.7.2 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html

To generate data and train and test the neural networks, run python networks.py, making sure that you have a data/ folder in the project directory. Optionally adjust parameters such as num_samples or epochs in the function make_and_train to change the number of samples generated and used for training, or the number of epochs the networks are trained for.

The python code for our data generation as well as miscellaneous helper functions can be found in data_generation.py, and the code for training, testing, and evaluating the neural networks on the data is in networks.py. A basic simulator which utilizes our CPS model can be found in sim.py.

Our code was tested to run in a virtual environment with requirements.txt installed for python 3.8.6.
