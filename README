The python code for our data generation as well as miscellaneous helper functions can be found in data_generation.py,
and the code for training, testing, and evaluating the neural networks on the data is in networks.py.

Our scripts were tested to run on Python version 3.8.6, and the only library necessary to install explicitly is PyTorch.
To install pytorch, run the following commands below in a terminal in the project directory,
then use the link https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ to select the version compatible with your system.
We used the pip installation for version 1.7.0 with CUDA 11, seen below

python3 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate

# depends on your system
python3 -m pip install torch==1.7.0+cu110 torchvision==0.8.1+cu110 torchaudio===0.7.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
